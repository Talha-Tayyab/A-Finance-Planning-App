
In this 6th sprint, we execute the following command in the terminal: "node testScript.js". 
This command generates user data and saves it in the database, 
specifically in the "user" and "budget" tables. Our focus is on creating 
complex model structures by establishing associations between the User 
and Budget models, as well as implementing validations to ensure 
data integrity.In this 6th sprint, we execute the following command in the
